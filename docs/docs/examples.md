## Examples

In this package we have also provided some customisation examples. Below is a brief description for each of them.

1. [context menu](./../../src/file_options.ts)
In this example we have customised the `file_options` context menu, to remove the `Delete` and `Edit` options, and replace the `Duplicate` option with a `Download` option.

2. [left panel](../../src/left_panel_container.ts)
In this example we have customised the `left tab panel`` to have another `tab` titled "TEST EXTENSION", and a corresponding `tab panel` which has a label: `Test Tab Panel`

3. [right panel](../../src/right_panel_container.ts)
In this example we have customised the `right tab panel` to have another `tab` titled "TEST EXTENSION", and a corresponding `tab panel` which has a label: `New Tab Panel`

4. [repository panel](../../src/repository_panel.ts)

5. [toolbar](../../src/toolbar.ts)
In this example we have replaced the `Insert Element`, `Insert Paragraph`, `Insert Numbered List`, `Insert Bulleted List` buttons with a single `More Insert Options` button containing all of these.

[Review App Examples](../../src/review_app_examples/)
1. [Annotation Toolbox](../../src/review_app_examples/annotation_extension.ts)
In this example we have added another button to the annotation toolbox that opens the current review topic in AEM.

2. [Review Comment](../../src/review_app_examples/review_comment.ts)
In this example we have added replaced the user name with user info (consisiting full name and title of the commenter), added a unique comment ID, a mailTo icon, and added input fields for mentioning comment severity and rationale. 

We have also added a `accept with modification` button on comments on the XMLEditor side that opens a dialogue.

3. [Comment Reply](../../src/review_app_examples/comment_reply.ts)
In this example we have added replaced the user name with user info (consisiting full name and title of the commenter), and added a mailTo icon in the comment header.

4. [Inline Review Panel](../../src/review_app_examples/inline_review_panel.ts)
In this file, we calculate and assign the unique comment ID, mentioned in the `Review Comment` and `Comment Reply` examples. 

- The `setCommentId` method sets the unique comment ID to each comment depending on the comment count.

- The `setUserInfo` sets the value of userInfo, using the full name and title for each comment.

- The `onNewCommentEvent` ensures the `setUserInfo` method is called for each new comment or reply.

- The `updatedProcessComments` function runs for each new comment Event, and ensures that `setCommentId` is called if we get a new comment event.

5. [Topic Reviews Panel](../../src/review_app_examples/topic_reviews.ts)

This file extends [Inline Review Panel](../../src/review_app_examples/inline_review_panel.ts) so that added customisations work on the Review App side as well.

6. [Accept with Modification Dialog](../../src/review_app_examples/accept_with_modification_dialog.ts)

This is an example of adding new widgets to the app. Here we have created a new dialogue, that has two input text fields: `Revised Text` and `Adjudicator Comment Rationale`
