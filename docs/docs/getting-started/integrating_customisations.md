# Integrating Customisations

Extensions give you the opportunity to customise your AEM Guides app to better suit your needs. This extension framework is supported with AEM Guides v4.3 onwards.

# Requirements:
This package requires [git bash](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and npm

# Installation

The easiest way to bootstrap AEM Guides framework installation is through cli
```bash
npx @adobe/create-guides-extension
```

# Adding customisation code

1. Add code files for each component you want to extend in the `src/` directory. Some sample files have already been added for you.
2. Now in the `index.ts` file located in the `src/` directory :
    - Import the `.ts` files with the customisations you want to add in your build.
    - Add the imports to `window.extension`
    - Register the customised component's `id` and corresponding import to `tcx extensions`
    - Refer to the sample [index.ts](../../../src/index.ts)

# Building the customised code

- Run `npm run build` in the root directory. You will get 3 files in the directory, `dist/`:
    - `build.css`
    - `guides-extension.js`
    - `guides-extension.umd.cjs`

<img
  src={buildOutput}
  title="Build Output"
  alt="build output"
  width= "500px"
  height="200px"
/>


# Adding the customisation to AEM
- Go to `CRXDE` `crx/de/index.jsp#/`
- Under the `apps` folder, make a new node of the type `cq:ClientLibraryFolder`

<img
  src={folderStructure}
  width= "250px"
  height="100px"
/>

- In the `properties` of the node, select `Multi` add the following property
    Name: `categories`
    Type: `String []`
    Value: `apps.fmdita.review_overrides`, `apps.fmdita.xml_editor.page_overrides`

<img
  src={folderProperties}
  width= "1000px"
  height="300px"
/>

- To add the built js, create a new file, say, `tcx1.js` in the above created node. Here, add the code from `dist/guides-extension.umd.cjs` or `dist/guides-extension.js`. Now create a new file `js.txt`, here we add the name of our js file, which in this case would be:
```t
#base=.
tcx1.js
```
- To add the built css, create a new file, say, `tcx1.css` in the above created node. Here, add the code from `dist/build.css`. Now create a new file `css.txt`, here we add the name of our css file, which in this case would be:
```t
#base=.
tcx1.css
```
- Do a `shift + refresh` to load the app with the customisations!

# Troubleshooting

Check that all the above steps were performed correctly. 
After adding your code to tcx.js, make sure to do a hard refresh (shift+refresh). 
Now open AEM, do a right click and click `Inspect`
Go to Sources and search for your `.js` (for eg: tcx1.js) file. Do a Control / Cmd + D to search for your file. If the `.js` file exists with the JS code you pasted from `dist/guides-extension.umd.cjs` or `dist/guides-extension.js`, your setup is complete
