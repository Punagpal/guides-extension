# Jui Framework

Before going into how to write extensions we'll understand the arcitecture of the framework.
So that we may extend it effectively.


## Introduction

JUI is a MVC framework on top of React and Adobe React Spectrum components. JUI is JSON User Interface. It consists of multiple git repositories.

JUI-Core is the core library with all logic to convert JSON config to working react components and link it with a relevant controller class instance.
JUI-React-Spectrum Â library has wrapper widgets of Adobe React Spectrum components
