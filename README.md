> This is a starting point for creating extension Adobe AEM Guides. Minimum required guides version is 4.3 (on-prem) and 2310 (cloud).

The AEM Guides Extension package allows you to customise the UI of your app as per your requirements. Some examples of customisations can be adding a button to a toolbar, a new input field in the comments box or another option in the context menu.

This repository contains the documentation to help you build and add these customisations to AEM Guides. Use the below steps to access the documentation:

## Running the Documentation
1. This repository needs [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

2. To run the documentation, in the `guides-extension/docs` directory, run the following commands:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
You can now access the documentation at default address: `localhost:3000/`
